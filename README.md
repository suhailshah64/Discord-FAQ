Requirements (if/when we open):

We’ll make a post if we ever need new mods or team members. Wait for that, then apply.

Due to heavy demand, only a limited number of users are picked each time to avoid chaos or server crashes.
But don’t worry — talk shows happen often so everyone gets a fair chance. Stay engaged and you’ll get your moment!
